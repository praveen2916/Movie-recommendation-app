# Movie-recommendation-app
using python flask webserver

This project is a demonstration of creating a Flask Web Server Application that renders a 
movie recommendation model created with lightfm package.  In this project popular 
movielens 100k dataset is used as an example.  

The algorithm used is  A hybrid latent representation recommender model which converts the 
sparsed matrices into condensed form by generating emmbeding based on features, and these 
features are summed together to arrive at representations for users and items.

This project demonstrates all the variations of hyperparmeters used in this algorithm to 
solve the embeddings.
